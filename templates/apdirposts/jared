<br /><i >“Climate Change on Mars:
The Case of the Missing Martian Atmosphere”</i>
<br />Mars was not always the dry, cold place we
see today.  Ancient gullies and
canyons were carved by flowing water, minerals that can only be made in
standing water formed, and the remnants of ancient volcanoes litter the
surface. Clearly, the atmosphere had to have been thicker and possibly warmer
at some point in the red planet’s past. What happened&#8204; Could the lack of a
planetary magnetic field be the culprit&#8204; The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, launching in November 2013 and
arriving at Mars in September 2014, will help us unravel the mystery of Mars’
changing climate.
