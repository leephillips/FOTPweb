      <h1>APS Programming</h1>
      <p>
The Arlington Planetarium is open for public multimedia programs on
weekends throughout the school year. For weekends not covered by Friends of
the Planetarium programming listed above, please consult the <a href="http://www.apsva.us/Page/2706">Arlington
   Public Schools website</a> for more details.
</p><p>
APS show times are: Fridays and Saturdays at 7:30PM and Sunday matinees at
1:30 and 3:00PM. The 3:00PM show on Sunday is usually a children's show. 
</p><p>
Additionally, <i>Stars Tonight</i>, a live sky show under the dome, highlighting
the celestial sights of the coming month, is offered the first Monday of
each school month at 7:30 PM (moved to second Monday during holidays).</p> 
<p>
For these regularly scheduled weekend shows, simply come to the Planetarium 15-20 minutes before the start of the show.  Seating is first come, first served, and no advance reservations are necessary.  There is an admission charge of $5 for ages from 13 to 59, $3 otherwise, cash only. Sky theater has a 58 seat capacity; once this is reached, the doors will be closed.
