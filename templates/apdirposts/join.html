<h3>How Are Dues Used?</h3>
<p>
All membership dues allow the purchase of new digital programming for community shows, sponsor planetarium training sessions for Arlington Public School (APS) teachers, assist with upgrades to the Planetarium facility, and support the <a href = '/donate/'>David M. Brown scholarship</a> for APS students.
</p>
<h3>How Long Does Membership Last?</h3>
<p>
The membership year has been set to coincide with the academic school year calendar.  Our membership drive kicks off in September of each year, and the membership period runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. 
</p><p>
Memberships can begin at any time during the year, and expire on the next September 30th.  Since summer months can be a bit uneventful, if you become a member between June 30 and September 30, your membership will be extended through the next membership year.
