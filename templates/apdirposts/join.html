</p>
<h3>How Long Does Membership Last?</h3>
<p>
The membership year has been set to coincide with the academic school year calendar.  Our membership drive kicks off in September of each year, and the membership period runs from September 1 to September 30 of the following year. 
</p><p>
Memberships can begin at any time during the year, and expire on the next September 30th.  Since summer months can be a bit uneventful, if you become a member between June 30 and September 30, your membership will be extended through the next membership year.
