  <h2>Talk About the Commercial Space Program with Carissa Christensen</h2>

  <p>
The aerospace industry is no longer defined by government space agencies. We live in a time when commercial firms have found ways to profit from the space environment. <img src = '/static/Carissa.jpg' class = 'mpic' alt = '' />Today's space businesses include satellite television delivered to millions of subscribers, images of the whole Earth taken by tiny remote sensing cubesats, suborbital vehicles that will carry tourists, and companies like SpaceX delivering supplies (and eventually astronauts) to the  International Space Station, as well as many others. Space entrepreneurship and investment have undergone unprecedented growth in recent years, and an exhilarating future awaits.

Carissa Bryce Christensen is a founder and Managing Partner of The Tauri Group, an analytic consulting firm based in Alexandria, Virginia. Ms. Christensen is a recognized expert in commercial space and for two decades has engaged the leading edge of the space industry with innovative analysis of space systems, industry economics, advanced technologies, unique regulatory requirements, and underlying demand.

<h2>The Zula Patrol: Under The Weather</h2>


<p>From the far reaches of outer space, from the bright orange planet Zula, comes the Zula Patrol! Based on the #1-rated NBC Saturday Morning TV series "The Zula Patrol," The Zula Patrol: Under the Weather is one of the top-performing digital dome shows of its genre.</p><img src = '/static/zulaPatrol.jpg' alt = '' class = 'mpic' />
<p>The story: the stalwart heroes of the Zula Patrol are on an expedition collecting samples of weather for scientist Multo's research -- using their loyal pet Gorga's ability to collect and bottle all kinds of weather. But when the Zula gang inadvertently hurts Gorga's feelings, he decides to leave Zula and find another planet to live on. Interplanetary villain Dark Truder then tricks Gorga into stealing the weather from other planets - part of his latest nefarious scheme to rule the Universe. The ZPers find out and go after him - in the process learning all about weather, both terrestrial and interplanetary.</p>
<p>Under the Weather is designed for children ages 4-9 and their families. Like the TV series (also airing on qubo, Telemundo, ION and PBS nationwide), it supports many national and state science education standards.</p>
